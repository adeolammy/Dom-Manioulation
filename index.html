<h1>CHAPTER I</h1>
<p>     It is with a kind of fear that I begin to write the history of my life. I have, as it were, a superstitious
        hesitation in lifting the veil that clings about my childhood like a golden mist. The task of writing an
        autobiography is a difficult one. When I try to classify my earliest impressions, I find that fact and
        fancy look alike across the years that link the past with the present. The woman paints the child's

        no king who has not had a slave among his ancestors, and no slave who has not had a king among
        his.
        My grandfather, Caspar Keller's son, "entered" large tracts of land in Alabama and finally settled
