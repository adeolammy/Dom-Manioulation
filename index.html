<h1>CHAPTER I</h1>
<p>    It is with a kind of fear that I begin to write the history of my life. I have, as it were, a superstitious
        hesitation in lifting the veil that clings about my childhood like a golden mist. The task of writing an
        autobiography is a difficult one. When I try to classify my earliest impressions, I find that fact and
        fancy look alike across the years that link the past with the present. The woman paints the child's
        experiences in her own fantasy. A few impressions stand out vividly from the first years of my life;

        childhood have lost their poignancy; and many incidents of vital importance in my early education
        have been forgotten in the excitement of great discoveries. In order, therefore, not to be tedious I
        shall try to present in element
        interesting and important.
        I was born on June 27, 1880, in Tuscumbia, a little town of northern Alabama.

        settled in Maryland. One of my Swiss ancestors was the first teacher of the deaf in Zurich and wrote
        a book on the subject of their educationâ€”rather a singular coincidence; though it is true that there is
        no king who has not had a slave among his ancestors, and no slave who has not had a king among
        his.
        My grandfather, Caspar Keller's son, "entered" large tracts of land in Alabama and finally settled
